# 🎯 Purchase Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary, using the **Social_Network_Ads** dataset.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Rows:** 400  
- **Features:**
  - Age (18–60 years)
  - Estimated Salary (15k–150k)
  - Purchased (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
   - Train-test split (25% training)

2. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression with `scikit-learn`

3. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Accuracy score
   - Prediction visualization for training and test sets
